# GodotSteam
Steam api for Godot game engine.

For Windows, Linux and (experimental) Mac.


How to use
----------
- Download [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com) and [Godot source](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).
- Copy:

  ```
  sdk/public
  sdk/redistributable_bin
  ```
  To
  ```
  godotsteam/sdk
  ```
  The directory contents should look like this:
  ```
  godotsteam/sdk/public/*
  godotsteam/sdk/redistributable_bin/*
  godotsteam/SCsub
  godotsteam/config.py
  godotsteam/godotsteam.cpp
  godotsteam/godotsteam.h
  godotsteam/register_types.cpp
  godotsteam/register_types.h
  ```
- Drop the "godotsteam" directory inside the "modules" directory on the Godot source. Recompile for your platform.

  For Linux, if not using Godot 2.0.3 or higher, you must add openssl=no when compile because it has problem with libcrypto (class StreamPeerSSL can't use).
  
  For Windows it's highly advised to use Visual Studio. With some extra steps MinGW will work, but most likely with limited functionality.

- Copy shared library (steam_api) to godot binary place, should look like this:

  Linux 32
  ```
  ./linux32/libsteam_api.so
  ./godot_binary
  ```
  
  Linux 64
  ```
  ./linux64/libsteam_api.so
  ./godot_binary
  ```
  
  Windows 32
  ```
  ./steam_api.dll
  ./godot_binary.exe
  ```
  
  Windows 64
  ```
  ./steam_api64.dll
  ./godot_binary.exe
  ```
